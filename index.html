                <p class="box_text"> Founded in 1066 by William the Conqueror, the Tower of London has been a potent symbol of the British monarchy for nearly 1000 years. 
                <br /> <br />  
                From its original use as the mighty fortress of the new Norman ruling elite, the Tower of London has also served as a Royal Mint, an armoury, the treasury, home of the Crown Jewels and of course, most infamously, since 1100 a prison. Being sent to the Tower became a famous phrase in London.

                Windsor Castle is the oldest and largest occupied castle in the world, one of the official residences of the Queen, and represents 900 years of British history.

                <br /> <br />     
                In the grounds of Windsor Castle London stands St. George’s Chapel, an active centre of worship open to the public, where Prince Edward was married.                    
                <br /> <br />    
                Another highlight of a trip to Windsor Castle is Queen Mary’s Dolls House, with its working lifts, water and electricity supply.

                The 1909 Gaston Leroux novel The Phantom of the Opera, which inspired Andrew Lloyd Webber's smash hit musical, is set in Paris’ Palais Garnier Opera House, where chorus girl Christine is coached to sing like “The Angel of Music” by the disfigured and disturbed Phantom of the Opera, Erik.
                <br /> <br /> 
                His obsession with her leads him to abduct her and threaten to blow up the Opera House if she tries to escape.

                Despite it’s slightly implausible storyline, the clever use of well known Abba hits to tell the tale makes Mamma Mia! the ultimate feel good musical that audiences can’t help singing along to!
                <br /> <br /> 
                The setting for Mamma Mia! is an idyllic Greek Island where young Sophie’s mother owns a taverna. Dismayed at the prospect of not having a father to walk her down the aisle, Sophie sets out to discover his identity,  finds three possible suspects in her mother’s old diary, and secretly invites them to her wedding. Romantic comedy Mamma Mia! does have a happy ending, but not quite the one the audience expects! Great fun night out for Abba fans of all ages!
